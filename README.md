# Numerical Analysis Project

This project is a comprehensive collection of **Numerical Analysis methods** implemented in Python using Jupyter Notebook.  
It covers interpolation, root-finding, iterative solvers, differentiation, integration, and solving differential equations.  
Additionally, it provides a simple **GUI interface (Tkinter)** for interactive use.
